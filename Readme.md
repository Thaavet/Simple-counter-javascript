Getting Started
Hi everyone, this is a project made for the Javascript basic course for Start2Impact.

What I made is a simple counter, using only Java and HTML, that allows you to increase or decrease the count by clicking the + and - keys or reset the count by returning the variable to the default (i.e. 0).
